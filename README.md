# Gravity KS Un-Silencers

These un-silencers are shaped like the black silicone silencer pad found inside Qanba Gravity KS 30mm buttons.

Simply removing the silencing pad would make the button louder and more tactile, but also increase the throw immensely.

These un-silencers were created to take the place of the original silencers, keeping the short throw while allowing the buttons to become louder and more tactile.

Test prints were done in 9000R white resin from jlcpcb.
